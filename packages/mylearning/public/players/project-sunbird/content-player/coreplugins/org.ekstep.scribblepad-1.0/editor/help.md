***Actions***

Objects on a stage can perform various actions in the content player when user clicks on them. Each action requires a target object to complete the action. Please ensure the target object is present before adding an action.

We suggest not to attach actions to a scribble pad

***Pro tip***

Place scribble pad over a shape, an image or a text to teach tracing of shapes, letters, and alphabets.
