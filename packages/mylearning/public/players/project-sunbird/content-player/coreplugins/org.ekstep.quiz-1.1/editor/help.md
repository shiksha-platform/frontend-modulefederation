**Question Set**

You can add question sets to your lesson to help a child practice the concept.

---

**_Shuffle Question_**

You can select a bunch of questions and shuffle them. Every time the lesson is played, questions will appear in shuffled order.

**_Show feedback_**

You can keep this ON to show an immediate feedback to the child whether the answer was correct or incorrect. This will help the child learn while practising.

You can turn this OFF and the child will move forward to the next question in the question set without getting any feedback on the answer submitted. This is useful for tests and assessments.

**_Pro tip_**

We suggest you select a large number of questions, set the question set to show a subset of those questions in shuffled order. This will help you create a practice quiz.

Please don't add any other drawing on the stage, where you are adding Quiz.

You can add a background image or shape, if you want to set a background for quiz.
